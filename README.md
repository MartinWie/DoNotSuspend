## See if this is working
Open "chrome://discards/" 
The column "AutoDiscardable" should off for all tabs.

## Disclaimer
If the browser forces tab hibernation caused by low system resources no software can stop this!
This extension only controls which tabs are favored to stay active as long as the system is capable of this.

## TODOs:  
- Add sync feature off chrome chrome.storage.sync.set and chrome.storage.sync.get for keywords
- Add vote for extension option
- Add functionality to discard / unload with special keyword
